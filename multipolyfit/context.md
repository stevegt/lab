i'm trying to understand how to fit an N-dimensional surface
to a set of N-dimensional points.  i want the fit to be polynomial,
not linear.  i want to be able to specify the degree of the polynomial
fit.

You are aiming to perform a polynomial regression on a dataset with
N-dimensional attributes. In this process, you want to fit an
N-dimensional surface that depicts the relationship of these
variables. Furthermore, you have a specific degree of polynomial in
mind that you would like to apply in the regression. Is there a
specific programming language or software you would like guidance on
to execute this?

i want to implement this in Go

Implementing a polynomial fit to an N-dimensional problem in Go can be
a bit challenging because Go, unlike some other languages like Python
or R, does not have many inbuilt scientific or data analysis
libraries. However, you can always write your own functions for this.

The general steps you would follow are:

1. Define a function to compute a polynomial of the desired degree,
   using coefficients to be determined.
2. Implement a least squares fitting procedure, which computes the
   "best" coefficients that minimize the sum of squares of residuals
   (differences between the model function and the data points) for
   the given data.
3. Implement a way to evaluate the model function with a given set of
   coefficients, and use this to compute residuals.
4. Implement an optimization loop (this could be a simple gradient
   descent procedure, for example) that iteratively adjusts the
   coefficients in order to minimize the sum of squares of residuals.

Remember to handle matrices carefully when implementing these steps,
as this problem involves N-dimensional attributes. Your data and
coefficients should likely be stored in matrices, and you'll need to
perform matrix multiplication and inversion in the least squares
procedure. 

If working with matrices is new to you, it may be helpful to first
implement a 1D version of this problem in Go and then extend it to
N-dimensions.

Here are some resources that may be helpful:
- [Polynomial regression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polynomial_regression)
- [Least squares fitting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Least_squares)
- [Matrix multiplication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_multiplication)
- [Matrix inversion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invertible_matrix#Inversion_of_2_%C3%97_2_matrices)
- [Gradient descent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradient_descent)

give me the alogrithm for this in pseudo-code

Sure, the process can be written in pseudo-code as follows:

```pseudo
initialize:
    data_matrix         // as D with dimensions nxN where n is the number of data points, and N is the dimension
    target_vector       // as y with dimensions nx1, which contains the target values for each data points
    degree_of_polynomial // user-defined degree of polynomial
    coefficient_vector  // as beta with your starting guessed coefficients (initialized with zeros or small random values)

do while (the change in the sum of squared residuals is greater than a small threshold value, or a certain number of iterations has been reached):
     
     calculate_predicted_targets:
         pred_y = matmul(D, beta)   // matrix multiplication of D (data_matrix) with beta (coefficient_vector)
     
     calculate_residuals:
         residuals = pred_y - y
     
     calculate_sum_of_squares:
         sum_of_squares = sum(residuals^2) // sum of squares of residuals
     
     compute_gradient:
         gradient = 2*matmul(transpose(D), residuals) // derivative of sum of squares wrt beta
     
     update_coefficients:
         beta = beta - learning_rate * gradient    // update rule, where learning_rate is a small, user-defined parameter
     
return beta  // return the optimized coefficients
```

This pseudo-code includes a simple version of the gradient descent
algorithm for optimizing the coefficients. In this algorithm, the
`learning_rate` is a parameter that affects how big the steps are in
each iteration of the algorithm. The appropriate choice of
`learning_rate` can have a big effect on the speed and accuracy of
convergence, so you may need to experiment a bit to find a good value.

This algorithm assumes that your data matrix `D` has been preprocessed
to include terms for multiple degrees of the polynomial. For example,
if you are fitting a 2nd degree polynomial, each row of `D` should
look like `[x_i, x_i^2]` for each datapoint `x_i`.

Please note, actual implementations of gradient descent often include
other features, such as a momentum term, adaptive learning rates, and
regularization. This pseudo-code does not include these features for
simplicity.



Is there a closed-form solution for a polynomial regression on a
dataset with N-dimensional attributes?  I want to fit an
N-dimensional surface that depicts the relationship of these
variables. Furthermore, I have a specific degree of polynomial in mind
that I would like to apply in the regression.

Polynomial regression can indeed handle N-dimensional input (or N
independent variables), but producing a closed-form solution becomes
complex as N increases. Moreover, its complexity is further compounded
when a specific degree of polynomial is desired.

The closed-form solution for a polynomial regression would involve
taking a pseudoinverse of the design matrix, which is formed by the
polynomial terms of the independent variables.

However, given the high dimensionality of the case presented, it might
become infeasible computationally to find the exact solution,
especially if the data are not well-behaved (for example, in cases of
collinearity, which is a common problem with high-degree polynomial
regression).

Instead of trying to obtain a closed-form solution, it's often more
feasible to use numerical methods such as gradient descent which is
implemented in your provided pseudo-code. This algorithm minimizes the
cost function using iterative optimization and is efficient for
large-scale datasets or complex models.

```pseudo
initialize:
    data_matrix         // as D with dimensions nxN where n is the number of data points, and N is the dimension
    target_vector       // as y with dimensions nx1, which contains the target values for each data points
    degree_of_polynomial // user-defined degree of polynomial
    coefficient_vector  // as beta with your starting guessed coefficients (initialized with zeros or small random values)

do while (the change in the sum of squared residuals is greater than a small threshold value, or a certain number of iterations has been reached):
     
     calculate_predicted_targets:
         pred_y = matmul(D, beta)   // matrix multiplication of D (data_matrix) with beta (coefficient_vector)
     
     calculate_residuals:
         residuals = pred_y - y
     
     calculate_sum_of_squares:
         sum_of_squares = sum(residuals^2) // sum of squares of residuals
     
     compute_gradient:
         gradient = 2*matmul(transpose(D), residuals) // derivative of sum of squares wrt beta
     
     update_coefficients:
         beta = beta - learning_rate * gradient    // update rule, where learning_rate is a small, user-defined parameter
     
return beta  // return the optimized coefficients
```

in gradient descent, what is the cost function?

In the context of gradient descent, and particularly in the given
pseudo-code related to polynomial regression, the cost function is the
sum of squares of residuals, defined as the square of differences
between the predicted output of the model and the actual output data
points. This cost function is minimized iteratively in the gradient
descent algorithm by adjusting the coefficients of the model.


can i use the sum of the absolute values of the derivatives of the
difference between the predicted output of the model and the actual
output data points as the cost function?

Yes, you can construct a cost function like this. It would be a form
of Mean Absolute Error. However, it's important to note a few things.
First, unlike the sum of squares cost function (which is often used
due to computational efficiency and ease), the absolute value cost
function might not be as computationally efficient because absolute
values do not possess nice analytical properties as squaring.


should i use the sum of the squares of the derivatives instead of the
sum of the absolute values of the derivatives?

Yes, the sum of squares of the residuals is more commonly used as a
cost function mainly because it has better mathematical properties. It
is continuously differentiable and easier to minimize in numerical
optimization. Squaring has the effect of amplifying large differences
and minimizing small ones, which often helps in robust model learning.
It is used in Least Squares method and has led to many well-researched
analytical solutions. However, the choice ultimately depends on the
specifics and requirements of your problem. Mean absolute differences
(like the L1 norm) can sometimes be robust against outliers compared
to the square of differences (L2 norm).

but absolute value should take fewer CPU cycles than squaring, right?

In pure computational terms, yes, calculating the absolute value
should take fewer CPU cycles than squaring. However, in the context of
optimizing a machine learning model using gradient descent, using the
sum of squares is more beneficial. This is because the derivative of
the sum of squares, which is used to update the model parameters,
provides more informative gradients and helps in more effective
convergence during the optimization process. Additionally, most modern
computing environments and libraries are highly optimized for these
sorts of calculations, so the potential computational advantage of
absolute over squaring may not be as significant in practice.



what is the difference between the sum of the squares of the
residuals and the sum of the squares of the derivatives?

The sum of squares of residuals is a measure of the difference between
the observed values and predicted values in a regression model. It is
used as a cost function in simple and multiple linear regression
models. 

On the other hand, the sum of squares of derivatives is not often used
directly as a cost function in machine learning algorithms. Rather,
derivatives come into play when we are trying to minimize the cost
function. In gradient descent algorithms, for example, we iteratively
adjust the model parameters in the direction opposite to the
derivative of the cost function, which is why we often see terms
involving the derivatives of the cost function in the update rules of
these algorithms. 

Therefore, the sum of squares of residuals is a measure of prediction
error, while the sum of squares of derivatives (more accurately, the
derivative of the sum of squares of residuals) is used to find the
direction of steepest descent to minimize that error.



if h(x) is:

    h(x) = b0 + b1 * x + b2 * x^2 + b3 * x^3 + b4 * x^4 + b5 * x^5

then what is the derivative of: 

    h(x)

The derivative of the function h(x) = b0 + b1 * x + b2 * x^2 + b3 * x^3 + b4 * x^4 + b5 * x^5 is:

   h'(x) = b1 + 2 * b2 * x + 3 * b3 * x^2 + 4 * b4 * x^3 + 5 * b5 * x^4

This results from applying the power rule of differentiation, which states that the derivative of x^n, where n is any real number, is n*x^(n-1).

*foo



if h(x) is:

    h(x) = b0 + b1 * x + b2 * x^2 + b3 * x^3 + b4 * x^4 + b5 * x^5

then, showing steps, show me the derivative of: 

    1/2 * m * sum((h(x) - y)^2)

Sure, let's clear out that the derivative here is in regard to the
coefficients of your `h(x)`. This will allow us to compute the
gradient of the function, which is what we'll need for the gradient
descent.

Let's denote:
- `E` = (h(x) - y)^2
- `C` = 1/2 * m * sum(E) 

We need to find the derivative of 'C' with respect to each `b_i`, from `b0` to `b5`.

The derivative of `C` with respect to a single `b_i` can be computed by applying the chain rule. Here's an example for `b0`:

dC/db0 = dC/dE * dE/db0

Let's compute those derivatives:

1) dC/dE = m * sum(E)
2) dE/db0 = 2 * (h(x) - y) * d(h(x))/db0

Now, `d(h(x))/db0` is just the derivative of h(x) with respect to `b0`, which is equal to 1 (as for other `b_i`, it'll be `x^i`). 

So, if we put it together:

dC/db0 = m * sum(E) * 2 * (h(x) - y) * 1
       = 2 * m * (h(x) - y) * sum((h(x) - y)^2)

This is the derivative of the original function with respect to `b0`.

For each `b_i`, the same steps should be followed, the only difference will be in the term `d(h(x))/db_i`, where for each `b_i`, it'll be `x^i`.



if h(x) is:

    h(x) = b0 + b1 * x + b2 * x^2 + b3 * x^3 + b4 * x^4 + b5 * x^5

show me pseudocode to calculate the derivative of:

    1/2 * m * sum((h(x) - y)^2)

It seems like you're asking for the derivative of the cost function
with respect to each coefficient b0, b1, ..., b5 for a polynomial
regression. Here's an example in pseudo-code that calculates the
gradient (i.e., the vector of all derivatives) for the given cost
function:

```
initialize gradient_vector with zeros // The gradient vector will hold the derivative for each coefficient 

for each training example i from 1 to m:
    calculate h(x_i) using h(x) equation and current coefficients 
    for each coefficient j from 0 to 5:
        gradient_vector[j] += (h(x_i) - y_i) * x_i(j)  // x_i to the power of j

multiply each value in gradient_vector by (1/m)
Return gradient_vector                               
```

In this pseudocode `x_i(j)` denotes x_i raised to the power j. 

Applying this gradient vector in your iterative optimization algorithm (like Gradient Descent) allows you to update the coefficients so as to minimize the cost function.



if h(x) is:

    h(x) = b0 + b1 * x + b2 * x^2 + b3 * x^3 + b4 * x^4 + b5 * x^5

show me Go code to calculate the derivative of:

    1/2 * m * sum((h(x) - y)^2)

The derivative of  `1/2 * m * sum((h(x) - y)^2)` with respect to bj is `(h(x)-y)*Xj` summed for every `x` in `X`. This could be derived using the chain rule of differentiation.

Given that, here is a simple illustrative Go code how you might
implement that. Note that it's just a very simplified example, real
implementations would include handling matrix operations, errors, and
would likely use a proper numerical computing or machine learning
library if available.

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"math"
)

type Observation struct{
	x []float64
	y float64
}

func h(b []float64, x []float64) float64 {
	hx := 0.0
	for i, bi := range b {
		hx += bi * math.Pow(x[0], float64(i))
	}
	return hx
}

func gradJ(b []float64, m float64, observations []Observation) []float64 {
	gradient := make([]float64, len(b))
	
	for _, obs := range observations {
		hx := h(b, obs.x)
		for j := range gradient {
			gradient[j] += (hx - obs.y) * math.Pow(obs.x[0], float64(j))
		}
	}
	
	for j := range gradient {
		gradient[j] *= m
	}
	
	return gradient
}

func main() {
	b := []float64{1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1}
	m := 0.5
	observations := []Observation{
		Observation{x: []float64{1}, y: 1},
		Observation{x: []float64{2}, y: 8},
		Observation{x: []float64{3}, y: 27},
	}

	fmt.Println(gradJ(b, m, observations))
}
```
In this code, `Observation` is a struct representing one data point, `h` is the function implementing `h(x)`, and `gradJ` calculates the gradient of `J` at `b`. 

Please note that you must modify this example according to your specific needs. This is a very basic example and will incorrect for more than 1 feature (multivariate case) because this assumes `h(x) = b0 + b1 * x + b2 * x^2 + b3 * x^3 + b4 * x^4 + b5 * x^5` and doesn't consider features apart from x[0]. For the full multivariate case, you would need to manipulate matrices, which is beyond Go's in-built capabilities.

show me an h(x1, x2, x3) that is a polynomial regression model

A polynomial regression model with three independent variables x1, x2, and x3 can be expressed as follows:

h(x1, x2, x3) = b0 + b1*x1 + b2*x1^2 + b3*x2 + b4*x2^2 + b5*x3 + b6*x3^2

This model is a second-degree polynomial. It includes linear and square terms of each variable and can model a variety of relationships between the variables. Note that the exact number and degree of polynomial terms can change to suit the specific problem and dataset.


if h(x1, x2, x3) is:

    h(x1, x2, x3) = b0 + b1 * x1 + b2 * x1^2 + b3 * x2 + b4 * x2^2 + b5 * x3 + b6 * x3^2

show me pseudocode to calculate the derivative of:

    1/2 * m * sum((h(x1, x2, x3) - y)^2)

The gradient calculation comes down to summing up, for every example in your training set, the product of the model's error on that example and the specific feature. Here's a version of the pseudocode:

```pseudo
initialize:
    m               // number of training examples
    alpha           // learning rate
    X[m][3]         // input data
    y[m]            // output data
    b[7]            // parameters of h, initialized to some values
    h_error[m]      // h(x) - y
    gradient[7]     // gradient of the cost function

for each epoch:
    for each training example i from 1 to m:
        // calculate prediction error
        h_error[i] = b0 + b1 * X[i][0] + b2 * X[i][0]^2 + b3 * X[i][1] + b4 * X[i][1]^2 + b5 * X[i][2] + b6 * X[i][2]^2 - y[i]
    
    for each coefficient j from 0 to 6:
        // compute the derivative w.r.t. bj
        gradient[j] = m * sum(h_error * X[j])  // sum over i, X[j] = X[i][0]^j for j<=2, X[i][1]^|j-3| for 3<=j<=4 and X[i][2]^|j-6| for j>=5

    for each coefficient j from 0 to 6:
        // update the coefficient
        b[j] -= alpha * gradient[j]

repeat until the change in cost function value is less than a small pre-defined threshold
```
Please note that this pseudocode assumes `h_error` and `X[][]` arrays are mathematically feasible, and you're utilizing a basic gradient descent algorithm. Depending on your programming language of choice and its capabilities, the actual implementation might need additional fine-tuning or modification.



if h(x1, x2, x3) is:

    h(x1, x2, x3) = b0 + b1 * x1 + b2 * x1^2 + b3 * x2 + b4 * x2^2 + b5 * x3 + b6 * x3^2

show me pseudocode to calculate the derivative and cost function of:

    1/2 * m * sum((h(x1, x2, x3) - y)^2)

Sure, I'll provide an example of pseudocode for calculating the gradient and cost: 

The model function has been extended to three variables `x1`, `x2`, and `x3`, and the polynomial degree for each variable is `2`.

Here's the pseudocode:

```pseudo
initialize:
    coefficients // array of size 7 (b0 to b6), initialized with zeros or small random values
    m // the number of training examples
    x // array of size m, each element is another array of size 3 (x1, x2, and x3 for each training example)
    y // array of size m, actual output data points

for each training example i from 1 to m:
    calculate h(x_i) using h(x1, x2, x3) equation and current coefficients 
    error = h(x_i) - y_i   // compute the difference between predicted and actual values
    cost += 0.5 * (error^2)  // compute the cost
    
    // construct polynomial features for current training example
    polynomial_x_iconcat i] = [1, x[i][0], x[i][0]^2, x[i][1], x[i][1]^2, x[i][2], x[i][2]^2]
    
    // compute the gradient for each coefficient
    for each coefficient j from 0 to 6:
        gradient_vector[j] += error * polynomial_x_i[j]

// divide cost by the number of training examples to get the average cost
cost = cost/m

// divide gradients by the number of training examples to get the average gradient
for each coefficient j from 0 to 6: 
    gradient_vector[j] = gradient_vector[j]/m
```

The above pseudocode first computes the cost (which is the mean
squared error). Then it computes the gradient of the cost function
with respect to each coefficient (b0 to b6). The computed gradients in
`gradient_vector` can be used to update the coefficients in the
direction that minimizes the cost function, typically using a
technique like gradient descent.



if h(x1, x2, x3) is:

    h(x1, x2, x3) = b0 + b1 * x1 + b2 * x1^2 + b3 * x2 + b4 * x2^2 + b5 * x3 + b6 * x3^2

show me pseudocode for a training loop that uses gradient descent to find the coefficients that minimize the cost function:

    1/2 * m * sum((h(x1, x2, x3) - y)^2)

Sure, here is a basic pseudocode for the given h(x1, x2, x3) in terms of a gradient descent algorithm for a polynomial regression:

```Pseudo
size of coefficients vector = num_variables * degree + 1
initialize coefficients b as zeros or small random numbers

define learning_rate (choose small value)

define threshold for convergence

num_variables = M
degree = N

while not converged:
    // initialize gradient_vector as zeros 
    // Dimensions of gradient vector should be same as the coefficients vector 
    gradient_vector = [0 for _ in range(num_variables * degree + 1)]

    for each training example i from 1 to m:
        calculate h(x1_i, x2_i, x3_i) using the h(x1, x2, x3) function and the current coefficients 

        calculate error = h(x1_i, x2_i, x3_i) - y_i 

        // gradient_vector[0] += error  // for b0
        // gradient_vector[1] += error * x1_i  // for b1
        // gradient_vector[2] += error * x1_i * x1_i  // for b2
        // gradient_vector[3] += error * x2_i  // for b3
        // gradient_vector[4] += error * x2_i * x2_i  // for b4
        // gradient_vector[5] += error * x3_i  // for b5
        // gradient_vector[6] += error * x3_i * x3_i  // for b6
        for var_index in range(num_variables):
            for deg in range(degree + 1):
                gradient_vector[var_index * degree + deg] += error * (x[var_index] ** deg)

    for each coefficient j from 0 to 6:
        coefficients[j] -= learning_rate * (1/m) * gradient_vector[j]

    if the change in cost function is less than threshold:
        converged = true
```

This pseudocode assumes that gradient descent is being run in batch
mode (all training examples are processed before the coefficients are
updated). It's important to carefully select the learning rate - if
it's too large the algorithm might not converge, if it's too small the
algorithm might take a long time to converge. 

Ultimately, also note that this is a rather simplistic implementation
and real-world uses may require modifications and additional features
such as regularization or momentum.

is there a technique that automatically adjusts the learning rate?

Yes, there are techniques that can automatically adjust the learning
rate. These techniques are commonly known as adaptive learning rates.
They usually involve increasing the learning rate when the cost
function is decreasing rapidly and decreasing it when the cost
function is not improving or is getting worse.

One popular method with adaptive learning rate is called AdaGrad
(Adaptive Gradient algorithm). In this algorithm, the learning rate is
adapted for each of the parameters individually based on the
historical gradient information. The learning rate for each parameter
decreases over time, so it is suitable for convex problems but may not
be ideal for non-convex problems where the aim is to reach a global
minimum.

Another method is the Adam (Adaptive Moment Estimation) optimizer,
which calculates an exponential moving average of the gradient and the
squared gradient, and the parameters beta1 and beta2 control the decay
rates of these moving averages. The Adam optimizer has been used
extensively in training deep neural networks.

These methods usually require tuning of their own hyperparameters. As
such, these methods can be more computationally expensive and more
complex to implement than basic gradient descent with a fixed learning
rate. Also, just like the learning rate in gradient descent, the
initial learning rate and the hyperparameters of these adaptive
learning rate methods may need to be adjusted based on the specific
problem at hand.

However, the advantage is that, with a well-tuned adaptive learning
rate method, you can often achieve faster convergence and can be less
sensitive to the initial choice of the learning rate.







if y = h(x1, x2, x3, ...xM) is a polynomial surface of degree N
describing the relationship between y and the M variables x1, x2,
x3, ...xM show me pseudocode for a training loop that uses
gradient descent to find the coefficients that minimize the cost
function given a training set containing S examples of M+1
dimensional data points.  Use s for the index of the training
example, c for the index of the coefficient, and m for the index of
the variable.

Sure, here's a basic skeleton of pseudocode for gradient descent in the context of a polynomial regression of degree N with M variables:

```pseudocode
Initialize coefficients[c] for c from 0 to N

Set learning_rate as desired

Repeat until convergence {
  
  Initialize gradient[c] for c from 0 to N
  
  for s from 1 to S do {

    Compute h(x[s])  // h(x[s]) represents the polynomial function
    Compute error[s] = h(x[s]) - y[s]

    for c from 0 to N do {
      Calculate gradient[c] += error[s] * (x[s, m] ^ c)
    }

  }
  
  for c from 0 to N do {
    Update coefficients[c] -= learning_rate * (gradient[c] / S)
  }

}
```

This pseudocode represents an implementation of batch gradient descent. In each iteration of the training loop, it makes predictions for the entire training set (indexed by s), and computes the gradient of the cost function with respect to each coefficient (indexed by c). The gradients are then used to update the coefficients in the direction that minimizes the cost. After updating the coefficients, the cycle repeats until the solution converges to an optimal set of coefficients.

Please note that this pseudocode assumes the power operator '^' is well-defined and efficient for your data type and platform. If not, you may need to replace the operation (x[s, m] ^ c) with a proper function call or code snippet that calculates power. Also, this pseudocode does not contain a specific term to stop the loop but ideally, you should include a condition to break the loop when the difference in cost function value between two iterations is less than a certain small predefined threshold. 

Bear in mind that this is a simplified version of the gradient descent algorithm. In practical scenarios, you might want to consider other factors such as regularization, momentum term for gradient descent, and adaptive learning rates among others.
