update DESIGN.md: 

- describe why acceptance of a message is a form of promise.  Discuss
  the definition of "accept" in the context of Church, Turing, and
  Chomsky.
- clarify whether it's true that the kernel communicates with modules
  via websockets.  revisit this design choice.
- discuss the design choice of using a separate Accept() and Handle()
  method -- does this not break promise theory's principle of
  not making promises on behalf of others?  I.E. if there is a separate
  Accept() and Handle() method, this means that the Accept() code path
  is making a promise on behalf of the Handle() code path.  What are
  the implications of this?  should this design be changed?
