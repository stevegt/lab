update DESIGN.md: 

- Regarding the design choice of using a separate `Accept()` and `HandleMessage()` method -- does this not break promise theory's principle of not making promises on behalf of others? If there is a separate `Accept()` and `HandleMessage()` method, this means that the `Accept()` code path is making a promise on behalf of the `HandleMessage()` code path. What are the implications of this? Should this design be changed?
- Add unknowns to the "Open Questions" section.
- Add suggestions for improvement to the "Suggestions for Improving this Document" section.
