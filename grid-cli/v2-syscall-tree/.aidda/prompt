update DESIGN.md: 

- describe why acceptance of a message is a form of promise.  Discuss
  the definition of "accept" in the context of Church, Turing, and
  Chomsky.
- clarify whether it's true that the kernel communicates with modules
  via websockets.  If so, explain why this is a good design choice.
