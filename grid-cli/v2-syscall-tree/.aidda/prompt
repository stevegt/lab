Improve DESIGN.md: 

- The design choice of using a separate `Accept()` and
  `HandleMessage()` method breaks promise theory's principle of not
  making promises on behalf of others.  Refactor the design to
  include a 'test' boolean in the `HandleMessage()` method to
  test if the message is acceptable.  If the message is acceptable,
  the `HandleMessage()` method should return a promise that the handler
  can handle the message.  

- Add unknowns to the "Open Questions" section.
- Add suggestions for improvement to the "Suggestions for Improving this Document" section.
