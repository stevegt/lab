update DESIGN.md: 

- describe how nodes interact with peers over the network via WebSocket connections
- decide whether websocket is the only transport or if we can have others
- decide how a sandboxed module can interact with the network
- decide whether the kernel should handle the WebSocket connection or if it should be handled by non-sandboxed modules


- Address unknowns in an "Open Questions" section.
