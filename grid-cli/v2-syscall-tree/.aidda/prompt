update DESIGN.md: 

- Resolve any XXX marks by reasoning about the design choices.  Seek
  improvements.  Address unknowns in an "Open Questions" section.
- Add missing footnotes 
- Wrap text lines at 70 characters
- discuss the design choice of using a separate Accept() and Handle()
  method -- does this not break promise theory's principle of
  not making promises on behalf of others?  I.E. if there is a separate
  Accept() and Handle() method, this means that the Accept() code path
  is making a promise on behalf of the Handle() code path.  What are
  the implications of this?  should this design be changed?
