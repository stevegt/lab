# PromiseGrid Kernel and Modules Design

## Overview

This document outlines the design considerations for implementing the
PromiseGrid kernel.  

## Simplified Message Structure

- **Message Structure**: The `Message` structure will have a unified
  format where the first element in the `Parms` field might be a
  promise. This simplifies the handling of messages and ensures a
  streamlined interface.

## Module Interface

- **Single `Accept()` Function**: The Module interface will include a
  single `Accept()` function. This function will handle all acceptance
  criteria based on the parameters (`parms...`), offering a flexible
  and modular approach to message handling.

## Hierarchical Syscall Tree

- **Ant Routing Mechanism**: A hierarchical syscall tree will function
  as an "ant routing" mechanism, caching successful paths to optimize
  future routing. This dynamic routing approach efficiently manages
  message delivery based on cached paths.

## Unified PromiseMessage

- **Promise Integration**: PromiseMessage will be treated as a simple
  `Message` with the promise potentially being the first element in
  `Parms`. This integration ensures that promises are foundational to
  the acceptance and handling process, enhancing reliability and
  trust.

## Dynamic Acceptance History and Syscall Table

- **Unified Table**: The `acceptanceHist` and `syscallTable` will be
  integrated into a dynamic syscall table that captures positive and
  negative acceptance history. This table serves as a core part of
  efficient request handling and module selection.

## Promise-Based Design

- **Deep Integration of Promises**: The design will emphasize
  "promises all the way down," ensuring the `Accept()` response itself
  might be a promise message. This depth in promise integration allows
  for a trust-based and accountable system.

## Error Handling and Promise Fulfillment

- **Promise Fulfillment**: Mechanisms will be developed to manage
  situations where a module's promise to handle a message isn't
  fulfilled, incorporating fallback or retry strategies. This ensures
  system resilience and maintains trust within the grid network.

## Conclusions

The PromiseGrid kernel and modules are designed with a focus on
simplicity, modularity, and trust. By deeply integrating promises and
optimizing routing through a hierarchical syscall tree, the system
aims to be flexible, efficient, and reliable. Further exploration and
implementation will refine these concepts into a robust grid computing
solution.
