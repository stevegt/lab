// Test execution of a subcommand with valid symbol table hash, subcommand hash, and localities
func TestExecuteSubcommand_ValidScenario(t *testing.T) {
	// This test requires setting up a mocked environment that simulates:
	// 1. A valid symbol table hash within the configuration.
	// 2. Corresponding symbol table data that includes a testable subcommand.
	// 3. Mock the response for fetching a module based on the subcommand hash.
	// 4. Ensure the fetched module (binary/script) can be executed.
	// As executing a subcommand involves network calls and executing binaries,
	// this would typically involve mocking network responses and the execution environment.

	// The implementation of this test would depend on the ability to mock or simulate
	// the necessary components within the test environment. This can be complex and require
	// a comprehensive setup, possibly involving interfaces and dependency injection for network calls
	// and external dependencies.
